Cooking Methods
Lamb Chops
SousVide : Cooking a vacuum packed item in a water bath at a controlled temperature and time to promote even cooking
Parsnip Puree
Simmer: To cook something just below the boiling point to keep it heated
Fig Demi Glace
Reduction: to evaporate water from a liquid mixture to both thicken and develop a more concentrated flavour

Minimum Internal Temperatures
Lamb Chops should be at 57 degrees celsius for a medium doneness
Parsnip Puree should be at 80-90 degrees celsius 
Fig Demi Glace should be at least 100 degrees celsius

Quality Standards
The lamb chops should have even colouring throughout the entire lamb rack. It should be even more tender than fork tender, tears apart with ease.
Parsnip puree should be smooth to the palette, seasoned properly and should not have strong flavours of garlic
The demi should be rich in flavour and have a nice thick consistency, should be ½ of the original volume. 
Holding Method
Chill/Cooling Method & Temperature
The lamb chops should be blast chilled until under 4 degrees Celsius
The parsnip puree should be blast chilled until under 4 degrees Celsius
The demi glace should be blast chilled until under 4 degrees Celsius

Storage Location and Temperature
Store the lamb chops with the jus in the walk in with other meats at a temperature of 0-4 degrees Celsius
Store the parsnip puree on line or in the walk in at a temperature of 0-4 degrees celsius
Store the demi glace on line or in the walk in at a temperature of 0-4 degrees celsius
Quality Standards of Finished Product
The lamb chops should be tender and evenly cooked stacked ontop of each other to create height and a visual appeal. The parsnip puree should be smeared across the plate (because the smear is totally not overused and is the epitome of plating) so that the entire plate is being utilized. The smear should have little well on it by the lamb chops so that when the rich and thick demi glace is poured over the lamb chops it does not flow onto the rest of the plate. The demi should enhance the flavour and should help with moisture even though the sous vide lamb should already be very moist and fork tender. The parsnip puree adds a contrasting colour to the plating for a more appetizing dish. Garnish with fresh herbs for that avant garde plating.
